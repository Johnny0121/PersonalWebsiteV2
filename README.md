# Personal Website 2.0

This repository holds an ASP.NET Core (3.3, MVC) project for my personal website that will be used for my final year at (Aston) university.

You can find a link to the site [here](https://www.johnny-le.me)!

This project does not use a database because I am poor and hosting a database alongside my app service is too costly for my thin pockets.

Enjoy :)
