# Personal Website 2.0

This repository holds an ASP.NET Core (3.1, MVC) project for my personal website that will be used for my final year at Aston university when looking for a graduate position.
You can find a link to the site [here](https://www.johnny-le.me)!

This project does not use a database because I am poor and hosting a database alongside my app service is too costly for my thin pockets.
Please feel free to critique my code if you see any improvements that could be made or any advice you could give me. I'd greatly appreciate it (I do know that some photos need to be cached to load faster :grin:)
